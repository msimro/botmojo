  "suggested_response": "A brief, friendly, and natural confirmation message for the user, written in the first person as the assistant. Assume the tasks are already done.",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "original_query_part": "The part of the user's query this task corresponds to.",

  "suggested_response": "The weather in San Francisco today is sunny with a high of 72Â°F. I've set a reminder for you to bring an umbrella tomorrow.",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": 1,
      "original_query_part": "What's the weather like in San Francisco today",
      "target_agent": "GeneralistAgent",
      "intent": "READ",
      "parameters": { "query": "current weather in San Francisco" },
      "tools": [
        {
          "tool_name": "weather",
          "tool_parameters": { "location": "San Francisco", "timeframe": "today" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "task_id": 2,
      "original_query_part": "remind me to bring an umbrella tomorrow",
      "target_agent": "PlannerAgent",
      "intent": "CREATE",
      "parameters": { "task_title": "Bring an umbrella", "due_date": "tomorrow" },
      "tools": [
        {

          "tool_parameters": { "event_type": "reminder", "title": "Bring an umbrella", "date": "tomorrow" }
        }
