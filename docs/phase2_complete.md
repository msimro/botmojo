# BotMojo Phase 2 Implementation - OOP Refactoring

## Overview

Phase 2 of the BotMojo project focused on a complete refactoring of the codebase to use proper Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, PSR standards, and namespaces. The goal was to transform the previously procedural code into a maintainable, extensible architecture that follows modern PHP best practices.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Modern OOP Structure
- Implemented proper namespaces (`BotMojo\Core`, `BotMojo\Agents`, `BotMojo\Tools`, `BotMojo\Exceptions`)
- Created abstract base classes for shared functionality
- Added interfaces to define clear component contracts
- Used PHP 8 features including strict typing

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Implemented a `ServiceContainer` for managing service dependencies
- Lazy-loading of services for improved performance
- Decoupled component interactions through the container
- Consistent service access throughout the application

### 3. Configuration Improvements
- Moved from hardcoded constants to .env file configuration
- Improved security by separating credentials from code
- Added better error handling for missing configuration
- Implemented environment-specific configuration

### 4. Error Handling
- Created custom `BotMojoException` with context preservation
- Standardized error responses with consistent JSON structure
- Added debug mode for detailed error information
- Improved logging of errors for troubleshooting

### 5. Request Processing Pipeline
- Reorganized the request flow through the `Orchestrator` class
- Clearly defined phases of request processing
- Better separation of concerns between components
- Improved input validation and sanitization

## Technical Details

### Core Classes
- `Orchestrator`: Central coordinator for request processing
- `ServiceContainer`: Dependency injection container
- `AbstractAgent`: Base functionality for all agents
- `AbstractTool`: Common tool functionality
- `BotMojoException`: Custom exception handling

### Tool Classes
- `DatabaseTool`: Entity storage and retrieval
- `GeminiTool`: Google Gemini AI API integration
- `HistoryTool`: Conversation history management
- `PromptBuilder`: Dynamic AI prompt assembly

### API Improvements
- Standardized JSON request/response format
- Better error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Improved security with input validation
- Debug mode for development and troubleshooting

## Next Steps for Phase 3

### Testing
- Implement PHPUnit tests for core components
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Additional Agents
- Complete implementation of remaining agent classes
- Ensure all agents follow consistent interface
- Improve agent specialization and coordination

### Frontend
- Enhance web interface with modern framework
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Add real-time conversation updates

### Performance
- Implement caching for frequently used data
- Optimize database queries and indexes
- Add performance metrics and monitoring

### Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Improve input validation and sanitization
