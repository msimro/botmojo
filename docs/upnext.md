## Dynamic Context Awareness System

### Overview: Advanced Context Building for AI Assistants

Our next major enhancement will be implementing a sophisticated context management system that enables BotMojo to maintain and leverage a rich understanding of user context, creating more personalized and intelligent interactions.

### üéØ Core Objectives

- Improve response relevance and personalization
- Reduce redundant information requests
- Enable proactive assistance based on context
- Create a scalable architecture for context management
- Balance token efficiency with context richness

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture: Multi-layered Context System

We'll implement a hierarchical context system with distinct layers:

1. **Core Identity Layer** (Always included)
   - Basic user information (name, preferences)
   - System configuration settings

2. **Temporal Context Layer** (Updated per session)
   - Current date, time, timezone
   - Season, holidays, special events
   - Time-based patterns and preferences

3. **Relational Context Layer** (Updated gradually)
   - Relationship history with entities
   - Interaction patterns and preferences
   - Social connections and network information

4. **Environmental Context Layer** (Updated per session)
   - Device information
   - Location and weather data
   - Ambient conditions when relevant

5. **Task Context Layer** (Updated frequently)
   - Current workflow state
   - Recent operations and commands
   - Task history and patterns

6. **Knowledge Context Layer** (Updated gradually)
   - User expertise in various domains
   - Learning history and preferences
   - Information consumption patterns

### üß© Implementation Components

1. **Context Registry**
   - Central registry for context providers
   - Versioning and validation system
   - Permission and privacy controls

2. **Context Providers**
   - Specialized classes for each context type
   - Standardized interfaces for context retrieval
   - Cache management and update strategies

3. **Context Selection Engine**
   - Vector-based relevance scoring
   - ML-powered context importance prediction
   - Token budget management

4. **Context Storage System**
   - Efficient database schema for context data
   - Hybrid SQL/NoSQL approach
   - Versioning and history tracking

5. **Context Analytics**
