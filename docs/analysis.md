#### **3. Unified Data Model**

**Database Schema:**
```sql
entities (id, user_id, type, primary_name, data[JSON], timestamps)
relationships (source_entity_id, target_entity_id, type, strength, metadata[JSON])
agent_logs (agent_name, input_data[JSON], output_data[JSON], performance_metrics)
conversation_analytics (user_input, triage_summary, agents_used[JSON], success_metrics)
```

**Data Model Strengths:**

- **Agent Pipelines**: Chain agents for complex multi-step operations
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute multiple agents simultaneously with result aggregation

**Recommendation:** Implement agent-to-agent communication for Phase 2

### **2. Data Flow Optimization**

**Current Flow:**
```
User → Triage → Agents → Database → Response (Synchronous)
```

**Enhanced Options:**
```
User → Triage → Event Bus → Async Agents → Stream Response (Asynchronous)
```

**Considerations:**
- Real-time response streaming for better UX
- Background processing for heavy operations
- Event sourcing for audit trails and replay capability
