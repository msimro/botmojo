 * - Maintains strict medical privacy and security standards
 * 
 * EXAMPLE USE CASES:
 * - "Track my blood pressure: 120/80"
 * - "I went for a 30-minute run today"
 * - "Log my water intake: 8 glasses"
 * - "I'm feeling stressed lately"
 * - "Remind me to take my medication"
 * - "Track my sleep: 7 hours last night"
 * - "I have a headache and feel tired"
