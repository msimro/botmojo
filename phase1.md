# Phase 1: AI Personal Assistant Core v1 - Complete

## 🎯 Project Overview

**AI Personal Assistant Core v1** is an intelligent, modular, multi-agent personal assistant built with a **triage-first, agent-based architecture**. The system understands and manages user life data through specialized AI agents.

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

- **Triage-First**: Every user input is analyzed by a specialized AI Triage Agent that creates structured JSON execution plans
- **Agent-Based**: Tasks are routed to specialized agents (Memory, Planner, Finance, Generalist) for modular processing
- **Component Assembly**: Agents create data components that are assembled into unified entities and stored in a flexible database

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8.3
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB (via DDEV)
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini 1.5-flash
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Development**: DDEV local environment
- **Memory/Cache**: File-based conversation cache

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Entities Table
- **Unified storage** for all life data (people, events, tasks, expenses, etc.)
- **JSON data field** containing agent-assembled components
- **Flexible typing** system for different entity categories
- **Full audit trail** with created/updated timestamps

### Relationships Table
- **Entity connections** and associations
- **Foreign key constraints** for data integrity
- **User-scoped** for future multi-user support

## 🤖 Agent System

### 1. MemoryAgent
- **Purpose**: Knowledge graph management
- **Handles**: People, places, objects, relationships
- **Components**: Names, attributes, relationships, notes, importance levels

### 2. PlannerAgent  
- **Purpose**: Time and task management
- **Handles**: Events, tasks, goals, reminders
- **Components**: Scheduling, priorities, locations, attendees, recurrence

### 3. FinanceAgent
- **Purpose**: Financial data processing
- **Handles**: Expenses, income, transfers
- **Components**: Amounts, categories, payment methods, currencies

### 4. GeneralistAgent
- **Purpose**: Fallback for general queries
- **Handles**: Conversations, questions, miscellaneous content
- **Components**: Content classification and context management

## 🔄 Processing Flow

1. **User Input** → Chat interface
2. **Triage Analysis** → AI analyzes intent and creates execution plan
3. **Agent Routing** → Tasks assigned to appropriate specialized agents
4. **Component Creation** → Agents process data into standardized components
5. **Entity Assembly** → Components unified into single entity structure
6. **Database Storage** → Entity saved with full context and metadata
7. **Response Generation** → User-friendly response returned to interface
